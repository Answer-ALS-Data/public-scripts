# OMOP Transformations & Mapping Repository

This repository contains public documentation, scripts, and resources related to OMOP transformations, mapping, and processing. It is designed to support the integration of datasets from Answer ALS and ALS TDI, both as individual datasets and as a unified OMOP dataset.

## Overview

The objective of this repository is to provide a centralized location for:
- **Data Transformations:** Scripts and procedures to transform source data into the OMOP Common Data Model.
- **Mapping Files:** Documentation and scripts for mapping source variables and terminologies to standard OMOP vocabularies.
- **Integration Processes:** Guidelines and tools for integrating Answer ALS and ALS TDI datasets, ensuring both separate and unified representations within OMOP.
